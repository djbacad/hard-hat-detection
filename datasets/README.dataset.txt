# Overview

The `Hard Hat` dataset is an object detection dataset of workers in workplace settings that require a hard hat. Annotations also include examples of just "person" and "head," for when an individual may be present without a hard hart.

The original dataset has a [75/25 train-test split](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split/).

# Use Cases

One could use this dataset to, for example, build a classifier of workers that are abiding safety code within a workplace versus those that may not be. It is also a good general dataset for practice.

# Using this Dataset

Use the `fork` or `Download this Dataset` button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model's desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better. This particular dataset would be very well suited for Roboflow's new advanced [Bounding Box Only Augmentations](https://blog.roboflow.ai/introducing-bounding-box-level-augmentations/).
